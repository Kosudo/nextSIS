## Welcome to the nextSIS project at GitHub

Our goal is to produce a user-friendly and developer-friendly open source student information system - SIS - designed for schools, by schools.

Right now, the project is in the planning and early development stage. In the meantime, please check out the [wiki] (https://github.com/Kosudo/nextSIS/wiki) where our design documentation is taking shape. You can also visit our website at [nextSIS.org] (http://nextsis.org) to read more information.

We'd love you to get involved in whatever capacity you can, as coders, testers, critics and generators of ideas. Make contact, and help us make a difference to the world of educational software.
